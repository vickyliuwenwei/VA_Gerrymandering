            <br>

            <h4 class="wu">Background and Motivation</h4><br>
            <p>Gerrymandering is a practice intended to establish a political advantage for a particular party of group by manipulating district boundaries. The Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) is a research group from Tufts University and MIT that focuses on applications of geometry and computing to U.S. redistricting and gerrymandering. They conduct research on the redistricting problem, build open-source tools and resources to enable the public to better understand districts and consequences and offer expertise opinion to different stakeholders on all sides. </p>

            <br>

            <p>The MGGG group generates large ensembles of districting plans to explore the underlying political geography of a given state. In the past, different measurements of gerrymandering have been presented to courts to support rationales to claim illegal gerrymandering. There is not yet a universally agreed-upon metric for evaluating splitting of municipal units with districting plans. Commonly used metrics usually focus on either geographical compactness (number of cuts and splits) or partisan symmetry and vote efficiency (efficiency gap, mean-median, number of seats won by a certain Party). </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>However, there is intricate interplay between the legal constraints and the measurements of interes and among the measurements themselves and the researchers have struggled to understand the trade-offs between these intertwined metrics. This is where we come in to help with an interactive data visualization system. </p>


            <h4 class="wu">Design rationale</h4><br>
                <p>Because the research group has very rich datasets and there are many different possibilities for our tool, it is important for us to focus on solving the most important pain-point for the researchers. At the same time, the target users of this tool will be the legislators, the court system and/or civil rights groups whom the MGGG group aims to educate and inform so it is important that we have a simple and effective design that does not involve overly complicated interaction techniques to overload the user. After several rounds of brainstorming and discussion sessions among ourselves and with the researchers, we discovered that the most urgent need of the researchers comes from the struggle to understand how the distributions of these different evaluation metrics interfere with each other, i.e. the tradeoffs between different constraints. </p>

                <br>

                <p>We use simulated data of 100,000 districting plans generated by a Markov Chain sampling technique (provided by MGGG). For this project, we focus on the state of Virginia and Pennsylvania to show that the relationships between the metrics of interest could different drastically from state to state and modeling needs to be done on the state level. For this phase, we only focus on the state of Virginia and use voting data from the 2017 Attorney General election to get estimate on the expected House of Representatives voting results (assuming all eleven districts will vote for the same party). Based on these expected results, we then compute six evaluation metrics for gerrymandering:</p>

                <br>

                <ul>
                  <li>cuts: Number of cut edges between the districts in the current plan</li>
                  <li>splits: Number of localities (county equivalents) that are split by the districting plan</li>
                  <li>egs: Efficiency Gap of the current plan</li>
                  <li>mms: Mean-Median of the current plan</li>
                  <li>hmss: # of seats won by the Dem party in the current plan</li>
                  <li>perc_dem: average percentage of democratic votes on state level</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When the user selects a reasonable range of a metric of their interest, it will filter the data and the other five metrics distribution will change accordingly. Hence the user can directly see how changing one metrics affects the other metrics. We also applied some transformations (log scale, scaling factors for percentage numbers, etc) on the scale of our metrics to make them effective on the histograms. 
                </p>

                <br>
                <p> Two goals we had in mind for this tool (but definitely welcoming more ideas!): </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Help user better understand the interaction between different metrics when you control for one of them</li>
                    <li>Educate user on the notion that looking at any particular metric or districting plan by itself is meaningless - this is why we use distributions of metrics across large ensembles of districting plans. What could be meaningful is how much of an outlier a plan is compared to the distribution of plans.</li>
                </ol>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Alternative options we considered but decided not to go for:
                </p>
                    
                <ol>
                    <li>Some geospatial visualization based on a map: </li>
                    <p>This was vetoed by the researchers because it is hard to show distributions (different possibilities) on a map. We also realized that this would not help us accomplish any of the goals above. If anything, it further fixates the notion of considering one particular plan instead of looking at the distribution of plans.</p>
                    <li>A visualization that covers the entire country including all states:</li>
                    <p>As we learned from some EDA and research, these metrics and how they interact differ drastically from state to state. So we decided to focus on two states and illustrate those differences instead. </p>
                    <li>Giving the user the freedom to draw maps and see the resulting metrics:</li>
                    <p>This would be a fun tool to have but would not be able to accomplish our goals because 1) they would not be able to see the distribution of each metric and the feasible region so will have nothing to compare their map with; 2) it would be very time-consuming without much help to the research group.</p>
                </ol>

            <h4 class="wu">Design rationale</h4><br>
                <p>See below for some earlier iterations of static visualizations done in Python matplotlib for exploration and data analysis purpose, with some insights we’ve learned from studying them:</p>

                <figure><img src="images/distribution_hmss.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch2"/><figcaption>Democratic Seats</figcaption></figure>
                <figure><img src="images/distribution_mms.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch3"/><figcaption>Mean Median</figcaption></figure>
                <figure><img src="images/distribution_nb_cuts.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch4"/><figcaption>Number of Cuts</figcaption></figure>
                <figure><img src="images/distribution_nb_splits.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch5"/><figcaption>NUmber of Splits</figcaption></figure>
                <figure><img src="images/distribution_perc_dem_votes.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch6"/><figcaption>Democratic Percentage Vote</figcaption></figure>
            
                <p>Insight: efficiency gap is really just share of democratic seats +/- some noise (not a very good metric at all - none of them are!).

                Insight: Mean median score is uniformly distributed across plans.
                </p>

                <figure><img src="images/against_egs_mms.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch7"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Mean Median</figcaption></figure>
                <p> Insight: The above graph shows about the correlation on distribution for efficiency gap and mean-median distribution. The smaller the absolute values of the gap, the larger the range for mean-median distribution, with tail towards left. Also, most observations lies in between reasonable efficiency gaps, with mean-median distribution (double exponential distribution) centered around 0.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/against_egs_hmss.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch8"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Democratic Seats</figcaption></figure>
                <o>The above graph shows the interaction of distribution between efficient gap and the number of seats won by democrat party. The most even distribution (with close to 0 efficiency gap) lies with 6 seats taken by the democrats, and the larger difference on efficiency gap will result in 7 seats taken by the democrats. <p>


                <figure><img src="images/against_hmss_mms.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch9"/><figcaption>Democratic Seats-Mean Median</figcaption></figure>
                <p>The smaller the number of seats taken by democrats, the larger the difference in mean-median distribution (for a number of more than 6 seats). What would be a good interpretation of such correlation? Shows that mean median is not a good indicator of # seats. The mean median left tail is a quite VA-specific thing.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/against_egs_perc_votes.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch10"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Vote Percentage</figcaption></figure>
                <p>When plotting the distribution of efficiency gaps against the distribution democratic vote shares, it is interesting to see the positive slope between those 2 metrics. Thus, as Democrats increase their vote share, the efficiency gap tends to suggest more of a Democratic advantage.
                </p>

                <figure><img src="images/aginst_cuts_egs.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch11"/><figcaption>Efficiency Gap-Cuts</figcaption></figure>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, this one shows that it is not necessarily true that fewer cuts mean better efficiency gap!
                </p>
                <figure><img src="images/added.jpeg" class="sk" alt="Sketch12"/></figure>
                <p>On average, Virginia is a “naturally” democratic state. The histogram shows the distribution of the ratio (#Dem seats / #Rep seats) across plans. It confirms that that ratio is more than 1 in most cases.</p>

            <h5 class="wu">Future Work/Commentary:</h5><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Have five sliding bars and allow users to set constraints on multiple metrics at once.
                    </li>
                    <li>Show an example that satisfies all of the constraint underneath, maybe in a map form.
                    </li>
                    <li>If we have a certain vector representing the BVAP (Black Voting-Age Population), how does the plan affect the partisan distribution? Measure impact of racial distribution on partisan. </li>
                    <li>Explore the possibility to show expected party vote percentage for each district in each plan of the ensemble, perhaps as a function of partisan imbalance across the state, on a map.</li>
                    <p> Show the same visualizations for the states of Pennsylvania and of Wisconsin, for the user to compare the metrics distributions and interactions between the 3 states
                    </p>
                </ol>
